# Workflow: Water Conservation Quiz Contest

## Technology Stack
The quiz contest is developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack with predefined questions stored in the database.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. **User Registration & Authentication**
- Users sign up using email or social media authentication.
- Authentication is handled using JWT for security.

### 2. **Quiz Structure & Question Handling**
- The quiz consists of multiple sections, each covering a different aspect of water conservation.
- Predefined questions are fetched from the MongoDB database.
- Each question has multiple-choice answers with one correct option.
- React.js is used to dynamically render questions.

### 3. **Scoring & Progress Tracking**
- Users earn points for each correct answer.
- Scores and progress are updated in real-time and stored in MongoDB.
- A leaderboard is maintained to encourage competition.

### 4. **Final Exam & Evaluation**
